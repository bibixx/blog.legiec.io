GitHub is no longer independent. Microsoft today acquired GitHub after a 10-year run as an independent company, for a solid $7.5 billion dollars. GitHub now has a long term home, and doesn’t need to go public.

Developer reactions across my own network and the wider internet have been broad, with some reacting positively but the vocal negative group is decrying GitHub going to that company.
I actually believe Microsoft acquiring GitHub is the _best result_ for everyone including GitHub itself, and wanted to take a look at how we ended up here.

## The struggle
For lack of a better analogy, GitHub has been wandering in the desert for [some time](). It’s a company that’s immensely well capitalized, with somewhere in the range of [$350M in venture capital money poured into it]() — but ultimately ended up stagnating as it grappled with the realities of business.
      
That wound up in the company shipping nothing meaningful for a number of years, which lead to many popular contributors writing an open letter to the company in 2016 about how poorly it had managed its own platform:
    
blockquote “However, many of us are frustrated. Those of us who run some of the most popular projects on GitHub feel completely ignored by you. We’ve gone through the only support channel that you have given us either to receive an empty response or even no response at all. We have no visibility into what has happened with our requests, or whether GitHub is working on them. Since our own work is usually done in the open and everyone has input into the process, it seems strange for us to be in the dark about one of our most important project dependencies.”
    
## Microsoft + GitHub = ❤
Over the last three years there’s been a seismic shift at Microsoft in the way it both thinks about building software, and how it shares it with the world. Famously insular under previous CEO, Steve Ballmer, his replacement, Satya Nadella, took the company in the other direction: opening up entirely.
**Microsoft’s acquisition of GitHub makes so much sense** in this context, because it gives the startup a new home, and unlimited runway to keep building its tools for open source while getting the structure it needs to succeed. While I’m generally not a fan of platform consolidation like this, I simply don’t believe GitHub could do it in the long run on its own.
